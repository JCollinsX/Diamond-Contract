# EIP-2535 Diamonds Implementation

This is a simple example implementation for [EIP-2535 Diamonds](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). To learn about other implementations go here: https://github.com/mudgen/diamond

The standard loupe functions have been gas-optimized in this implementation and can be called in on-chain transactions. However keep in mind that a diamond can have any number of functions and facets so it is still possible to get out-of-gas errors when calling loupe functions. Except for the `facetAddress` loupe function which has a fixed gas cost.

The `contracts/Diamond.sol` file shows an example of implementing a diamond.

The `contracts/facets/DiamondCutFacet.sol` file shows how to implement the `diamondCut` external function.

The `contracts/facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol` file shows how to implement the four standard loupe functions.

The `contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol` file shows how to implement Diamond Storage.

The `test/diamondTest.js` file gives tests for the `diamondCut` function and the Diamond Loupe functions.

## How to Get Started Making Your Diamond

1. The most important thing is reading and understanding [EIP-2535 Diamonds](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). If something is unclear let me know!

2. The second important thing is using an EIP-2535 Diamonds reference implementation. You are at the right place because this is the README for a reference implementation.

This diamond implementation is boilerplate code that makes a diamond compliant with EIP-2535 Diamonds.

Specifically you can copy and use the [DiamondCutFacet.sol](./contracts/facets/DiamondCutFacet.sol) and [DiamondLoupeFacet.sol](./contracts/facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol) contracts as is. They implement the `diamondCut` function and the loupe functions.

The [Diamond.sol](./contracts/Diamond.sol) contract could be used as is, or it could be used as a starting point and customized. This contract is the diamond. Its deployment creates a diamond. It's address is a stable diamond address that does not change.

The [LibDiamond.sol](./contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol) library could be used as is. It shows how to implement Diamond Storage. This contract includes contract ownership which you might want to change if you want to implement DAO-based ownership or other form of contract ownership. Go for it. Diamonds can work with any kind of contract ownership strategy.

The [LibDiamondCut.sol](./contracts/libraries/LibDiamondCut.sol) library contains an internal function version of `diamondCut` that can be used in the constructor of a diamond or other places.

## Calling Diamond Functions

In order to call a function that exists in a diamond you need to use the ABI information of the facet that has the function.

Here is an example that uses web3.js:

```javascript
let myUsefulFacet = new web3.eth.Contract(MyUsefulFacet.abi, diamondAddress);
```

In the code above we create a contract variable so we can call contract functions with it.

In this example we know we will use a diamond because we pass a diamond's address as the second argument. But we are using an ABI from the MyUsefulFacet facet so we can call functions that are defined in that facet. MyUsefulFacet's functions must have been added to the diamond (using diamondCut) in order for the diamond to use the function information provided by the ABI of course.

Similarly you need to use the ABI of a facet in Solidity code in order to call functions from a diamond. Here's an example of Solidity code that calls a function from a diamond:

```solidity
string result = MyUsefulFacet(diamondAddress).getResult()
```
